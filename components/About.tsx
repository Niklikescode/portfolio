            Firstly, thanks for stopping by!
            <br />
            <br />
            My professional career up to now has predominantly been in the
            technology space within a sales and managerial/client-relations
            capacity, where I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working with some
            amazing companies across a diverse collection of industries.
            I&apos;ve been lucky enough to work and learn from some of the best
            in the business, and I&apos;ve been able to take away some
            invaluable experiences and knowledge from each of these roles.
            <br />
            <br />
            I&apos;ve always had a passion for creativity from a very young age,
            which stems from a fascination of the way things work. Beyond the
            typical childhood antics, I would often spend my time doodling,
            painting, playing instruments, building model planes, cooking,
            baking, or just trying to be the next Paul Daniels - I had the set.
            Ultimately, whatever it was that I was doing, it fundamentaly
            involved <em>making</em> something. As such I&apos;ve always been
            drawn to the idea of creating something from nothing, and I&apos;ve
            always been interested by the idea of building something that can be
            used by others.
            <br />
            <br />
            In late 2023 I was extremely fortunate to had been selected from
            over 3000 applicants to The School of Code alongside 89 other
            successful candidates. This was a 16-week
            <em> ridiculously</em> intensive yet life-changing and rewarding
            bootcamp in Full-Stack Software and Web Development, where I was
            able to learn and develop my skills and work on some brilliant
            projects alongside a very talented and diverse mix of people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since graduating and being released back into the world now armed
            with a whole new skillset, the aim is to build some cool, useful and
            hopefully lucrative stuff whilst also growing my skills with the
            right people - focusing on the AI, Bitcoin or wider crypto space.
            I&apos;m also working on a few personal projects which I&apos;m
            hoping to share with you soon!
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of all this, you&apos;ll often find me in the kitchen,
            settling in to a good book or a good movie, trading, weightlifting,
            playing basketball and tennis or generally dominating the pool
            table. As for music, I like all genres and especially live, though I do have a penchant for old-school Hip Hop.
            <br />
            Most of all, I LOVE travelling the world üåç
            <br />
            <br />
            I&apos;ll wrap it up here and leave you with my website, where
            roughly 7 months prior to its completion, I had never written a
            single line of code in my life...
            <br />
            <br />
            If you&apos;d like to chat, feel free to drop me a message or give
            me a shout through the contact page below. I&apos;d love to hear
            from you!
