            Firstly, thanks for stopping by! I guess a good place to begin would
            be explaining why I&apos;m here. Well, boring part first... my
            professional career up to now has predominantly been in the
            technology space within a sales and managerial/client-facing
            capacity, where I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working with some
            amazing companies across a diverse collection of industries.
            I&apos;ve been lucky enough to work and learn from some of the best
            in the business, and I&apos;ve been able to take away some
            invaluable experiences and knowledge from each of these roles.
            <br />
            <br />
            I&apos;ve always had a passion for creativity from a very young age,
            which stems from a fascination of the way things work. As a kid, if
            I wasn&apos;t doing the more common and stupid things kids get up
            to, I would often spend my time drawing, painting, playing
            instruments, building model planes, clay modeling*, cooking, baking
            or trying to be the next Paul Daniels - yes I did have the set.
            Ultimately, whatever it was that I was doing, it fundamentaly
            involved{" "}
            <em>
              <strong>making</strong>
            </em>{" "}
            something. As such I&apos;ve always been drawn to the idea of
            creating something from nothing, and I&apos;ve always been
            interested by the idea of building something that can be used by
            others.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through academia, computer science did interest me a lot, however I
            didn&apos;t quite have the prerequisites to go down that path, and
            so I ended up studying Business and Marketing at University, which
            has served me pretty well up to now. Fast forward to present day and
            bootcamps are now a thing! I was extremely fortunate enough to have
            been selected from over 3000 applicants to The School of Code
            alongside 89 other successful candidates. This was a 16-week
            <em> ridiculously</em> intensive yet life-changing and rewarding
            bootcamp in Full-Stack Software Development, where I was able to
            learn and develop my skills and work on some amazing projects with a
            very talented and diverse mix of people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since graduating and being released back into the world now armed
            with a whole new skillset, the aim is to build some cool (and
            hopefully lucrative) stuff whilst also growing my skills with the
            right people. I&apos;m also working on a few personal projects which
            I&apos;m hoping to share with you soon.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of all this, you&apos;ll often find me in the kitchen,
            travelling the world, weightlifting, settling in to a good book or a
            good movie, playing basketball and tennis or whooping ass at pool,
            and delving in to all things old-school Hiphop - especially live.
            Most of all... I LOVE a social.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is probably a good place to wrap things up as I can go on
            forever, but if you do want to chat, feel free to drop me a message
            or give me a shout through the contact space below. I&apos;d love to
            hear from you!
            <br />
            <br />
            With that, I&apos;m excited to see where this journey takes me as I
            navigate these tricky waters (pic intended), and I&apos;m looking
            forward to sharing it all with you! ðŸš€
