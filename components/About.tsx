            Firstly, thanks for stopping by! I guess a good place to begin would
            be by explaining why I&apos;m here. Well... my professional career up to
            now has predominently been in technology and within a sales,
            managerial and client-facing capacity, where I&apos;ve had the pleasure
            of working with some amazing companies across a diverse collection
            of industies. I&apos;ve been lucky enough to work and learn from some of
            the best in the business, and I&apos;ve been able to take away some
            invaluable experiences and knowledge from each of these roles.
            <br />
            <br />
            I&apos;ve always had a passion for technology from a very young age,
            which stems from a fascination of the way things work. As a kid I
            would often spend my time building model planes, painting, clay
            modelling, cooking or baking (along with all the stupid stuff kids
            get up to). Ultimately, whatever it was that I was doing, it
            fundamentaly involved <em>making</em> something. As such I&apos;ve always
            been drawn to the idea of creating something from nothing, and I&apos;ve
            always been interested by the idea of building something that can be
            used by others.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through academia, computer science did interest me a lot, however I
            didn&apos;t quite have the prerequisites to go down that path, and so I
            ended up studying Business and Management at University, which has
            served me pretty well up to now. Fast forward to present day and
            bootcamps are now a thing! I was extremely fortunate enough to
            had been selected from over 3000 applicants to The School of Code
            alongside 89 other successful candidates. This was a 16-week
            <em>ridiculously</em> intensive yet life-changing and rewarding
            bootcamp in Full-Stack Software Development, where I was able to
            learn and develop my skills and work on some amazing projects with a
            very talented and diverse mix of people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since we have now been released into the world having graduated and
            now armed with a whole new skillset, the aim is to build some cool
            (and hopefully lucrative) stuff whilst also growing my skills with 
            the right people. I&apos;m also working on a few
            personal projects which I&apos;m hoping to share with you soon.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of all this, you may find me travelling the world, cooking,
            baking, weightlifting, settling in to a good book or a good movie,
            playing basketball or tennis, and delving in to all things
            old-school Hiphop - especially live. Most of all... I love a social,
            and I&apos;ll likely talk your ear off (incase you haven&apos;t already
            noticed.)
            <br />
            <br />
            This is probably a good place to wrap things up as I can go on
            forever, but if you do want to chat, feel free to drop me a message
            or give me a shout through the contact space below!
            <br />
            <br />
            With that, I&apos;m excited to see where this journey takes me as I
            navigate these tricky waters, and I&apos;m looking forward to sharing it
            with you! ðŸš€
